## Code Contributions

Looking to contribute to Simplecov? You can look for any tickets tagged with `help-wanted`

- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/dev-generator/devgenerator.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which could use help form the community to help complete

## Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Dev Generator's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Dev Generator Interaction
- Enable a sustainable system for Dev Generator's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

- Follow all instructions in [the template](https://github.com/dev-generator/devgenerator.io/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing<details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in opening an Issue or perhaps opening a pull request. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in Dev Generator. We  encourage you to read about [other search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which will help you write more focused queries.
